# Welcome to the EOS documentation!

This documentation is continuously written. It is edited via text files in the
[Markdown/ Markedly Structured Text](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
markup language and then compiled into a static website/ offline document using the open source tool
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and will someday land on
[Read the Docs](https://akkudoktoreos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

You can contribute to EOS's documentation by opening
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS/issues)
or sending patches via pull requests on its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS).
