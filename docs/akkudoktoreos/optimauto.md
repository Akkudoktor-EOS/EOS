# Automatic Optimization

## Introduction

EOS offers two approaches to optimize your energy management system: `post /optimize optimization` and
`automatic optimization`.

The `post /optimize optimization` interface, based on a **POST** request to `/optimize`, is widely
used. It was originally developed by Andreas at the start of the project and is still demonstrated
in his instructional videos. This interface allows users or external systems to trigger an
optimization manually, supplying custom parameters and timing.

As an alternative, EOS supports `automatic optimization`, which runs automatically at configured
intervals. It retrieves all required input data — including electricity prices, battery storage
capacity, PV production forecasts, and temperature data — based on your system configuration.

### Genetic Algorithm

Both optimization modes use the same core optimization engine.

EOS uses a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to find an optimal
control strategy for home energy devices such as household loads, batteries, and electric vehicles.

In this context, each **individual** represents a possible solution — a specific control schedule
that defines how devices should operate over time. These individuals are evaluated using
[resource simulations](#resource-page), which model the system’s energy behavior over a defined time
period divided into fixed intervals.

The quality of each solution (its *fitness*) is determined by how well it performs during
simulation, based on objectives such as minimizing electricity costs, maximizing self-consumption,
or meeting battery charge targets.

Through an iterative process of selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm gradually evolves
more effective solutions. The final result is an optimized control strategy that balances multiple
system goals within the constraints of the input data and configuration.

:::{note}
You don’t need to understand the internal workings of the genetic algorithm to benefit from
automatic optimization. EOS handles everything behind the scenes based on your configuration.
However, advanced users can fine-tune the optimization behavior using additional settings like
population size, penalties, and random seed.

## Energy Management Plan

Whenever the optimization is run, the energy management plan is updated. The energy management plan
provides a list of energy management instructions in chronological order. The instructions lean on
to the [S2 standard](https://docs.s2standard.org/) to have maximum flexibility and stay completely
independent from any manufacturer.

### Battery Instructions

The battery control instructions assume an idealized battery model. Under this model, the battery
can be operated in four discrete operation modes:

| **Operation Mode ID** | **Description**                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IDLE**              | Battery neither charges nor discharges; holds its state of charge.                   |
| **CHARGE**            | Charge at a specified power rate up to the allowable maximum.                        |
| **DISCHARGE**         | Discharge at a specified power rate up to the allowable maximum.                     |
| **ALLOW_DISCHARGE**   | Allow the battery to freely discharge depending on its instantaneous power setpoint. |

The **operation mode factor** (0.0–1.0) specifies the normalized power rate relative to the
battery's nominal maximum charge or discharge power. A value of 1.0 corresponds to full-rate
charging or discharging, while 0.0 indicates no power transfer. Intermediate values scale the power
proportionally.

### Electric Vehicle Instructions

The electric vehicle control instructions assume an idealized EV battery model. Under this model,
the EV battery can be operated in two operation modes:

| **Operation Mode ID** | **Description**                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IDLE**              | Battery neither charges nor discharges; holds its state of charge.                   |
| **CHARGE**            | Charge at a specified power rate up to the allowable maximum.                        |

The **operation mode factor** (0.0–1.0) specifies the normalized power rate relative to the
battery's nominal maximum charge power. A value of 1.0 corresponds to full-rate charging, while 0.0
indicates no power transfer. Intermediate values scale the power proportionally.

### Home Appliance Instructions

The home appliance instructions assume an idealized home appliance model. Under this model,
the home appliance can be operated in two operation modes:

| **Operation Mode ID** | **Description**                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **RUN**               | The home appliance is started and runs until the end of it's power sequence.         |
| **IDLE**              | The home appliance does not run.                                                     |

The **operation mode factor** (0.0–1.0) is ignored.

## Configuration

### Energy management configuration

The energy management is run on configured intervals with some startup delay after server start.
Both values are given in seconds.

:::{admonition} Note
:class: note
If no interval is configured (`None`, `null`) there will be only one energy management run at
startup.
:::

The energy management can be run in two modes:

- **OPTIMIZATION**: A full optimization is done. This includes update of predictions.
- **PREDICTION**: Only the predictions are updated.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "ems": {
        "startup_delay": 5.0,
        "interval": 300.0,
        "mode": "OPTIMIZATION"
    }
}
```

### Optimization Configuration

#### Optimization Time Configuration

- **horizon_hours**:
    The optimization horizon parameter defines the default time window — in hours — within which
    the energy optimization goal shall be achieved.

    Specific devices, like the home appliance, have their own configuration for time windows. If
    the time windows are not configured the simulation uses the default time window.

    Each device simulation run must ensure that all tasks or appliance cycles (e.g., running a
    dishwasher) are completed within the configured time windows.

- **interval**: Defines the time step in seconds between control actions
    (e.g. `3600` for one hour, `900` for 15 minutes).

:::{warning}
**Current Limitation**

At present, the `interval` setting is **not used** by the genetic algorithm. Instead:

- The control interval is fixed to **1 hour**.

Support for configurable intervals (e.g. 15-minute steps) may be added in a future release.
:::

#### Genetic Algorithm Parameters

The behavior of the genetic algorithm can be customized using the following configuration options:

- **individuals** (`int`, default: `300`):
  Sets the number of individuals (candidate solutions) in the (first) generation. A higher number
  increases solution diversity and the chance of finding a good result, but also increases
  computation time.

- **generations** (`int`, default: `400`):
  Sets the number of generations to evaluate the optimal solution. In each generation, solutions are
  evaluated and evolved. More generations can improve optimization quality but increase computation
  time. Best results are usually found within a moderate number of generations.

- **seed** (`int` or `null`, default: `null`):
  Sets the random seed for reproducible results.

  - If `null`, a random seed is used (non-reproducible).
  - If an integer is provided, it ensures that the same optimization input yields the same output.

    A fixed seed to ensure reproducibility. Runs with the same seed and configuration will
    produce the same results.

- **penalties** (`dict`):
  Defines how penalties are applied to solutions that violate constraints (e.g., undercharged
  batteries). Penalty function parameter values influence the fitness score, discouraging
  undesirable solutions.

:::{note}
**Supported Penalty Functions**

Currently, the only supported penalty function parameter is:

- `ev_soc_miss`:
  Applies a penalty when the **state of charge (SOC)** of the electric vehicle battery falls below
  the required minimum. This encourages the optimizer to ensure sufficient EV charging.
:::

#### Value Formats

- **Time-related values**:
  - `hours`: specified in **hours** (e.g. `24`)
  - `interval`: specified in **seconds** (e.g. `3600`)

- **Genetic algorithm parameters**:
  - `individuals`: must be an **integer**
  - `seed`: must be an **integer** or `null` for random behavior

- **Penalty function parameter values**: may be `float`, `int`, or `string`, depending on the type
  of penalty function.

#### Optimization configuration example

```json
{
    "optimization": {
        "hours": 24,
        "interval": 3600,
        "genetic" : {
            "individuals": 300,
            "generations": 400,
            "seed": null,
            "penalties": {
                "ev_soc_miss": 10
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Device simulation configuration

The device simulations are used to evaluate the fitness of the individuals of the solution
population.

The GENETIC algorithm supports 4 devices:

- **inverter**: A photovoltaic power inverter that can export to the grid and charge a battery.
  The inverter is mandatory.
- **electric_vehicle**: An electric vehicle, basically the battery of an electric vehicle. The
  The electrical vehicle is optional.
- **battery**: A battery that can be charged by the inverter. The battery is mandatory.
- **home_appliance**: A home appliance, like a washing machine or a dish washer. The home
  appliance is optional.

:::{admonition} Warning
:class: warning
The GENETIC algorithm can only use the first inverter, electrical vehicle, battery, home appliance
that is configured, even if more devices are configured.

        ]
    },
    "measurement": {
        "electric_vehicle_soc_keys": ["ev1_soc"]
    }
}
```

#### Battery simulation configuration

    "devices": {
        "max_batteries": 1,
        "batteries": [
            {
                "device_id": "battery1",
                "capacity_wh": 8000,

                "time_windows": null,
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The time windows the home appliance may run can be [configured](#configtimewindow-page) in several
ways. See the [time window configuration](#configtimewindow-page) for details.

## Predictions configuration

The device simulation may rely on predictions to simulate proper behaviour. E.g. the inverter needs
to know the PV forecast.

Configure the [predictions](#prediction-page) as described on the [prediction page](#prediction-page).

### Providing your own prediction data

If EOS does not have a suitable prediction provider you can provide your own data for a prediction.
Configure the respective import provider (ElecPriceImport, LoadImport, PVForecastImport,
WeatherImport) and use one of the following endpoints to provide your own data:

- **PUT** `/v1/prediction/import/ElecPriceImport`
- **PUT** `/v1/prediction/import/LoadImport`
- **PUT** `/v1/prediction/import/PVForecastImport`
- **PUT** `/v1/prediction/import/WeatherImport`

## Measurement configuration

Predictions and device simulations often rely on **measurement data** to produce accurate results.
For example:

- A **load forecast** requires past energy meter readings.
- A **battery simulation** needs the current **state of charge (SoC)** to start from the correct
  condition.

Before using these features, make sure to configure the [measurement](#measurement-page) as
described on the [measurement page](#measurement-page).

### Providing your own measurement data

You can provide your own measurement data to the prediction and simulation engine through the
following REST endpoints (see the [measurement page](#measurement-page) for details on the data
format):

- **PUT** `/v1/measurement/data`
- **PUT** `/v1/measurement/dataframe`
- **PUT** `/v1/measurement/series`
- **PUT** `/v1/measurement/value`

### Example: Supplying Battery and EV SoC

For **batteries** and **electric vehicles**, it is strongly recommended to provide
**current SoC**. This ensures that simulations start with the correct state.

The simplest way is to use the `/v1/measurement/value` endpoint.
Assuming the battery is named `battery1` and the EV is named `ev11`:

1. **Use the measurement keys** that are pre-configured for your **devices**. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "devices": {
            "batteries": [
                {
                "device_id": "battery1", "capacity_wh": 8000,  ...
                "measurement_key_soc_factor": "battery1-soc-factor", ...
                }
            ],
            "electric_vehicles": [
                {
                "device_id": "ev11", "capacity_wh": 8000,  ...
                "measurement_key_soc_factor": "ev11-soc-factor", ...
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Record your SoC readings** to these keys.

   - Enter the values as **factor of total capacity** of the respective **battery**.

In these examples:

- datetime specifies the timestamp of the measurement.
- key is the measurement key (e.g. battery1-soc-factor).
- value is the numeric measurement value (e.g. SoC as factor of total capacity).

#### Raw HTTP request

```http
PUT http://127.0.0.1:8503/v1/measurement/value?datetime=2025-09-26T16%3A39&key=battery1-soc-factor&value=0.57
PUT http://127.0.0.1:8503/v1/measurement/value?datetime=2025-09-26T16%3A39&key=ev11-soc-factor&value=0.22
```

#### Equivalent curl commands

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:8503/v1/measurement/value?datetime=2025-09-26T16%3A39&key=battery1-soc-factor&value=0.57"
curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:8503/v1/measurement/value?datetime=2025-09-26T16%3A39&key=ev11-soc-factor&value=0.22"
```

### Example: Supplying Load Data

To provide your actual load measurements in Akkudoktor-EOS:

1. **Configure the measurement keys** for your load energy meters. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "measurements": {
            "load_emr_keys": ["my_load_meter_reading", "my_other_load_meter_reading"]
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Record your meter readings** to these keys.

   - Enter the values exactly as your energy meters report them, in **kWh**.
   - Use the same approach as when supplying battery or EV SoC data.
