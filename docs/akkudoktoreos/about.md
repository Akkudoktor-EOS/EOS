# About Akkudoktor EOS

The Energy System Simulation and Optimization System (EOS) provides a comprehensive solution for
simulating and optimizing an energy system based on renewable energy sources. With a focus on
photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery storage (batteries), load management (consumer requirements),
heat pumps, electric vehicles, and consideration of electricity price data, this system enables
forecasting and optimization of energy flow and costs over a specified period.
