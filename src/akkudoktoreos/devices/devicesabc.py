class BatteryOperationMode(StrEnum):
    """Battery Operation Mode.

    Enumerates the operating modes of a battery in a home energy
    management simulation. These modes require no direct awareness
    of electricity prices or carbon intensity â€” higher-level
    controllers or optimizers decide when to switch modes.

    Modes
    -----
    - IDLE:
        No charging or discharging.

    - SELF_CONSUMPTION:
        Charge from local surplus and discharge to meet local demand.

    - NON_EXPORT:
        Charge from on-site or local surplus with the goal of
        minimizing or preventing energy export to the external grid.
        Discharging to the grid is not allowed.

    - PEAK_SHAVING:
        Discharge during local demand peaks to reduce grid draw.

    - GRID_SUPPORT_EXPORT:
        Discharge to support the upstream grid when commanded.

    - GRID_SUPPORT_IMPORT:
        Charge from the grid when instructed to absorb excess supply.

    - FREQUENCY_REGULATION:
        Perform fast bidirectional power adjustments based on grid
        frequency deviations.

    - RAMP_RATE_CONTROL:
        Smooth changes in local net load or generation.

    - RESERVE_BACKUP:
        Maintain a minimum state of charge for emergency use.

    - OUTAGE_SUPPLY:
        Discharge to power critical loads during a grid outage.

    - FORCED_CHARGE:
        Override all other logic and charge regardless of conditions.

    - FORCED_DISCHARGE:
        Override all other logic and discharge regardless of conditions.

    - FAULT:
        Battery is unavailable due to fault or error state.

    -----
    - OFF:
        Stop or prevent any active operation of the appliance.
